Escape (The Pina Colada Song) -- Rupert Holmes

    If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
    If you're not into yoga, if you have half-a-brain...
    ....

I'd never actually listened to the lyrics very carefully before this, but they're pretty horrible.  Effectively, both parties in a relationship decide to cheat on each other via the personals page, and end up contacting each other... and discovering that they like the same things.

Go ahead and read through the lyrics sometime, they're an excellent example of a relationship in which everything has gone terribly awry-- emotional distance, complete failure of communication, adultery, and pina coladas (which frankly aren't all that great).
