(with apologies to Edsger Djikstra)

This is not in the same vein as Djikstra's piece-- he was describing that, by understanding that we as programmers are limited in the amount of data we can effectively tore and use, we should therefore not try to build programs which exceed this capacity.  The essay has aged tolerably well; we are able to produce much more expressive and elegant code that we could when the essay was written, but we are still bounded by our ability to interpret and correct complexity in code (how well we can "play machine").

Djikstra's point is that "we the programmer humans" are limited.  My point is "I, the programmer, am human."  How does a humble programmer think and behave, and why is it better to be (and work with) a humble programmer rather than a proud one?
