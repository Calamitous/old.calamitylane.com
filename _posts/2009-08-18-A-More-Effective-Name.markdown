A quick note:

If you are:
* Using Rails
* Using RSpec
* Have just discovered the incredible joy of named scopes

...restrain yourself, by any means available (up to and including physical violence) from creating a named scope called "public" or "private."  The reasons for this should be fairly obvious.

Really, whoever ends up cleaning up behind you will appreciate it.
