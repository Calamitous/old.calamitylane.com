      <h4>Why Calamity Lane?</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Two weeks before marriage, Michelle is laid off from her job.</li>
        <li>One week after marriage, Eric is laid off from his job.</li>
        <li>One year later, Eric is laid off from his new job.  He gives up programming in disgust.</li>
        <li>One year later, Eric gets another job&#8230; programming.  Some people never learn.</li>
        <li>Two months later, Hurricane Katrina kicks their roof in.</li>
        <li>Two years later, they have a child, and it looks like Eric.  Calamitous!</li>
        <li>Three months later, lighting and high wind knock over a tree and destroy nearly every piece of electric equipment in their home.</li>
        <li>At the same time, the neighbor&#8217;s house burns down.</li>
        <li>To be continued&#8230;?</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Ouch, BUT&#8230;</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>On the day of marriage, they are married</li>
        <li>Two months after marriage, they move to a new city for Eric&#8217;s new job, which pays much better.</li>
        <li>Three weeks later, they find a lovely old home to live in.</li>
        <li>The same day Eric is laid off, Michelle gets a new job&#8211; <em>at the same company</em></li>
        <li>One year later, Eric gets another job&#8230; which pays much better.</li>
        <li>Michelle continues to be employed.</li>
        <li>Two months later, they escape from harm as Hurricane Katrina rips through.</li>
        <li>Also, many of their personal possessions are salvageable, including most of those with sentimental value.</li>
        <li>Michelle continues to be employed.</li>
        <li>Two years later, they have a child, and it looks like Michelle.  Congratulations!</li>
        <li>Two months later, Eric gets another job&#8230; which pays much better.</li>
        <li>Three months later, lighting and high wind knock over a tree, and nobody is hurt, except for a little mild electrocution.</li>
        <li>Not even the neighbors whose house burned down.</li>
        <li>Although the firemen are slightly irritated at being called out to their block so many times in one night.</li>
        <li>Michelle continues&#8211; so far&#8211; to be employed.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Don&#8217;t let calamity sour the good times :)</p>
