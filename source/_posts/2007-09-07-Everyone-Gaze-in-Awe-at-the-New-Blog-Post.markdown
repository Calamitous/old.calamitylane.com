Soooo... yeah, I've basically failed to do anything interesting with my blog for a while.  I have determined that the root cause of this is not laziness, but INADEQUATE SOFTWARE.  Thus, I'm switching from Mephisto to Radiant.  

Mephisto is OK, but on a lightweight VPS slice like mine it fills the RAM, settles itself comfortably onto the swap partition, and stays there eating all the chips and never cleaning the toilet.  Also, the Mephisto guys make releases somewhat less often than I post, so it's not exactly fresh software.

Anyway, welcome to the new blog!  Please be patient while I work out the kinks.
