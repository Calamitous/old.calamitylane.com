I'm compelled to highlight a gem I found in our codebase the other day. If you ever find yourself writing something like: 

<div class="ruby"><pre style="overflow: hidden;"><code class="line_number" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em">1</code><code><span class="ident">variable</span> <span class="punct">==</span> <span class="ident">value</span> <span class="punct">?</span> <span class="constant">true</span> <span class="punct">:</span> <span class="constant">false</span>
</code></pre></div>

...go sit in the corner and think about what you did wrong.
