After having participated in and presided over a few projects that ended in failure, I'd like to share a few ways that you can tell you're in trouble, and what you can('t) do to fix it.

"Ended in failure" is a bit of a dodge; generally, failures are ongoing, demolished only when someone finally proposes The Big Rewrite, thus setting up the next failed project.

You can't rewrite a failed project with new technology or software and expect it to fix a failed project *if you are using the same process.*  No amount of whiz-bang technology will fix your process mistakes.

Programmers aren't (generally) dumb, but managing programmers involves balancing a variety of broken personalities.

* Don't add contractors to a late project

* Bad estimates are probably your fault

* You are not a unique snowflake, your company is not special, and you don't have any insight or talent that makes it possible for you to skip over the realities of development
