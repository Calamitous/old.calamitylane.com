For all those times when you've been thinking to yourself "Man, this would be the perfect situation in which to play a zombie song," I'm glad to say modern independent musicians have stepped up to fill this gap:

* Jonathan Coulton, [Re: Your Brains](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQYjZc7gKXc)
* No More Kings, [Zombie Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9BRUe4yToQ)

Further zombie song recommendations are welcome in the comments.
